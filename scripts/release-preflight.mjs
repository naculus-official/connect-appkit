 * Release preflight — refuse to publish appkit from an incoherent state.

 *   node scripts/release-preflight.mjs --expect <version>  # packs, hits npm
 *
 * connect-lib has had one of these for a while. appkit did not, and its
 * publish workflow is `pnpm -r publish` against whatever versions happen to be
 * in package.json — so nothing stood between a mistake and npm.
 *
 * The specific failure this exists to stop already nearly happened.
 * `@naculus/connect-appkit-wc` appeared in zero changesets while `react` and
 * `vue` both depend on it with `workspace:*`. `pnpm pack` rewrites that into
 * an exact version, so bumping react and leaving wc behind publishes a react
 * that pins the *previous* release's web components. Nothing would have
 * reported it; the packages install and the wrong ones load.
 *
 * There is no override flag, for the same reason connect-lib's has none: a
 * failure here means the release is not safe, and an escape hatch is reached
 * for at exactly the wrong moment.
