 * What the connected wallet says it can do — EIP-5792

 *
 * The query a dApp makes *before* choosing how to execute: ask whether the
 * wallet batches atomically, then send one batch or a sequence, rather than
 * sending a batch and learning the answer from a rejection.
 *
 * Identical in substance to the React hook, because every decision in it —
 * normalising the raw answer, the CAIP-2/hex lookup, and `"unknown"` meaning
 * "not told" rather than "no" — is in `@naculus/connect-appkit-core` and
 * neither binding gets to disagree about it.
 *
 * Takes its client, session and chain as arguments. Vue has no equivalent of
 * the React provider here, which is the same shape `useChain` uses.
