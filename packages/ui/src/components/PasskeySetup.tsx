 * without it can never unlock anything, and the only route forward is
 * registering a new one — so the result of the attempt has to be reported
 * honestly rather than as a generic success.
 *
 * A passkey protects the local copy, not the wallet. The recovery phrase is
 * still the only backup that survives losing the device, and that has to be
 * said here, at the moment someone turns this on, rather than in a document
 * they will not read.
